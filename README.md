# GaMorNet

GaMorNet is a Convolutional Neural Network based on AlexNet to classify galaxies morphologically. GaMorNet does not need a large amount of training data (as it is trained on simulations and then transfer-learned on a small portion of real data) and can be applied on multiple datasets. Till now, GaMorNet has been tested on ~100,000 SDSS g-band galaxies and ~20,000 CANDELS H-band galaxies and has a misclassification rate of <5%. 

The training, testing and relevant statistics of GaMorNet is outlined in the following paper:-
