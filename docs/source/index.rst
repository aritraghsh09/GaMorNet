About GaMorNet
==============

.. note::
   **20th Nov. 2020**: Yale Astronomy's public FTP server is back online and all services should work as usual. 
   If you are still having issues while using our trained models or trying out the tutorials, please let us know. 

   A tarball of all the public data products is now also available via `Google Drive <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yIuCe_CcxzOLsNAPR5H40MPH-tbvpBJb/view?usp=sharing>`_. 

The Galaxy Morphology Network (GaMorNet) is a convolutional neural network that can classify galaxies as being disk-dominated, bulge-dominated or indeterminate based on their bulge to total light ratio. GaMorNet doesn't need a large amount of training data and can work across different data-sets. For more details about GaMorNet's design, how it was trained etc., please refer to :ref:`pub_and_other_data`.

.. _first_contact:

First contact with GaMorNet
---------------------------
GaMorNet's user-faced functions have been written in a way so that it's easy to start using them even if you have not dealt with convolutional neural networks before. For. eg. to perform predictions on an array of SDSS images using our trained models, the following line of code is all you need. 

.. code-block:: python

   from gamornet.keras_module import gamornet_predict_keras

   preds = gamornet_predict_keras(img_array, model_load_path='SDSS_tl', input_shape='SDSS')


In order to start using GaMorNet, please first look at the :ref:`getting_started` section for instructions on how to install GaMorNet. Thereafter, we recommend trying out the :ref:`tutorials` in order to get a handle on how to use GaMorNet. 

Finally, you should have a look at the :ref:`usage_guide` for our recommendations on how to use different elements of GaMorNet's public data release for your own work and the :ref:`api_docs` for detailed documentation of the different functions in the module. 


.. _pub_and_other_data:

Publication & Other Data
------------------------
You can look at this `ApJ paper <https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ab8a47>`_ to learn the details about GaMorNet's architecture, how it was trained, and other details not mentioned in this documentation. 

We strongly suggest you read the above-mentioned publication if you are going to use our trained models for performing predictions or as the starting point for training your own models.

All the different elements of the public data release (including the new Keras models) are summarized in :ref:`usage_guide`.
