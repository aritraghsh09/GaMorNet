About GaMorNet
==============
The Galaxy Morphology Network (GaMorNet) is a convolutional neural network which can classify galaxies as being disk-dominated, bulge-dominated or indeterminate based on their bulge to total light ratio. For more details about GaMorNet's design, how it was trained etc., please refer to :ref:`pub_and_other_data`.
