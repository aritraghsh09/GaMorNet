Tutorials
=========

We have created the following tutorials to get you quickly started with using GaMorNet. To look into the details of each GaMorNet function used in these tutorials, please look at the :ref:`api_docs`.

You can either download these notebooks from GitHub and run them on your own machine or use `Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/>`_ to run these using Google GPUs. 

Each Notebook has separate sections on using the Keras and TFLearn modules. 


.. _prediction_tutorial:

Making Predictions
------------------

This tutorial demonstrates how you can use GaMorNet models to make predictions using two images from our SDSS dataset.
